# Prototype-2-Exports

## Environment, Events, and Inventory

This prototype adds on to the features made in prototype 1. The emphasis here is to polish the environment some more
and create an example game scenario by creating a small game loop.

## Features

### User Interface

A simple user interface thats helps guide the player and progress the story.

- **Hints**: Hints explaining the controls appear on the top left corner of the screen.
- **Dialogue**: Intended dialogue appears at the bottom of the screen as subtitles.
- **Inventory**: Far from implemented, by pressing tab, an inventory will appear, displaying held items.
  
### Updated Map

Made in blender, this prototype has updated 3D models for the narrative to take place.

### Interactable Objects

Key objects can now be interacted with by moving close to them and pressing the interact command "E"

- Coffee maker: Adds coffee to inventory.
- Office door: Progresses story
  
### Story Tree

Added different possible events based on the items stored in the inventory.

## Reflection

Development is speeding up now that I have the difficult things out of the way. I like where development is going so
far but I know that I'm taking a lot of shortcuts to save time while prototyping. Once I begin working on the demo
I know that the game will be a lot more polished, but each feature will take a lot more time to implement.

I'm happy with the modeling I've done so far, in one of the future prototypes I'd like to come back and make textures
for this room to really nail the intended atmosphere. But the next prototype will most likely be focused on combat or a
battle system.
